Description: The package provides procedures for selecting sites for spatial
    surveys using spatially balanced algorithms applied to discrete points,
    linear networks and polygons. The probability survey designs available include
    independent random samples, stratified random samples, and unequal probability
    random samples (categorical or probability proportional to size). Design-
    based estimation based on the results from surveys is available for estimating
    totals, means, quantiles, cdfs, and linear models. The analyses rely on Lumley's
    package "survey" for most results. Variance estimation options include a local
    neighborhood variance estimator that is appropriate for spatially-balanced
    survey designs.
