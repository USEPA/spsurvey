Description: The spsurvey package provides functions for selecting and analyzing
    probability samples. To select spatially balanced probability samples,
    spsurvey implements the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS)
    algorithm.  The GRTS algorithm can be applied to finite resources (point geometries) 
    and infinite resources (linear and polygon / areal geometries) and flexibly accommodates a diverse set of sampling
    design features, including stratification, unequal inclusion probabilities,
    proportional (to size) inclusion probabilities,
    legacy (historical) sites, minimum distances between sites,
    and two options for replacement sites. To analyze probability samples, spsurvey
    implements a wide range of analysis functions that cover categorical variable analysis, continuous
    variable analysis, relative risk analysis, attributable risk analysis, 
    risk difference analysis, change analysis, and trend analysis.
    spsurvey can also be used to plot and summarize data, select samples that are not spatially balanced,
    compute spatial balance metrics, select panel samples, and more.
