Description: The spsurvey package provides functions for selecting and analyzing
    probability samples. spsurvey implements the Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified (GRTS)
    algorithm, used to select spatially balanced probability samples. The GRTS
    algorithm works for finite and infinite resources (point, linear, and areal 
    geometries) and flexibly accommodates a diverse set of sampling
    design features, including stratification, unequal selection probabilities,
    legacy (or historical) sites, minimum distances between sites,
    and two options for replacement sites. spsurvey also implements several
    analysis approaches, including categorical variable analysis, continuous
    variable analysis, relative risk analysis, attributable risk analysis, 
    risk difference analysis, change analysis, and trend analysis, among others.
    spsurvey can also be used to plot and summarize data, generate non-spatially 
    balanced samples, compute spatial balance metrics, and more.
