\arguments{
\item{z}{Vector of the response value for each site.}

\item{wgt}{Vector of the final adjusted weight (reciprocal of the sample
inclusion probability) for each site, which is either the weight for a
single- stage sample or the stage two weight for a two-stage sample.}

\item{x}{Vector of x-coordinate for location for each site, which is either
the x-coordinate for a single-stage sample or the stage two x-coordinate
for a two-stage sample.}

\item{y}{Vector of y-coordinate for location for each site, which is either
the y-coordinate for a single-stage sample or the stage two y-coordinate
for a two-stage sample.}

\item{val}{Vector of the set of values at which the CDF is estimated.}

\item{cdfest}{The CDF estimate.}

\item{stratum_ind}{Logical value that indicates whether the sample is
stratified, where \code{TRUE} = a stratified sample and \code{FALSE} = not a stratified
sample.}

\item{stratum_level}{Vector of the stratum level.}

\item{cluster_ind}{Logical value that indicates whether the sample is a
two- stage sample, where \code{TRUE} = a two-stage sample and \code{FALSE} = not a
two-stage sample.}

\item{clusterID}{Vector of the stage one sampling unit (primary sampling unit
or cluster) code for each site.}

\item{wgt1}{Vector of the final adjusted stage one weight for each site.}

\item{x1}{Vector of the stage one x-coordinate for location for each site.}

\item{y1}{Vector of the stage one y-coordinate for location for each site.}

\item{pcfactor_ind}{Logical value that indicates whether the finite
population correction factor is used during variance estimation, where \code{TRUE}
= use the population correction factor and \code{FALSE} = do not use the factor.
To employ the correction factor for a single-stage sample, a value must be
supplied for argument \code{fpcsize}.  To employ the correction factor for a
two-stage sample, values must be supplied for arguments \code{Ncluster} and
\code{stage1size}.}

\item{fpcsize}{Size of the resource, which is required for calculation of the
finite population correction factor for a single-stage sample.}

\item{Ncluster}{The number of stage one sampling units in the resource,
which is required for calculation of the finite population correction
factor for a two-stage sample.}

\item{stage1size}{Vector of the size of the stage one sampling units of a
two-stage sample, which is required for calculation of the finite
population correction factor for a two-stage sample.}

\item{vartype}{The choice of variance estimator, where \code{"Local"} = local mean
estimator and \code{"SRS"} = SRS estimator.}

\item{warn_ind}{Logical value that indicates whether warning messages were
generated, where \code{TRUE} = warning messages were generated and \code{FALSE} = warning
messages were not generated.}

\item{warn_df}{A data frame for storing warning messages.}

\item{warn_vec}{Vector that contains names of the subpopulation type, the
subpopulation, and the response variable.}
