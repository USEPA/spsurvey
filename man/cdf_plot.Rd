\usage{
cdf_plot(
  cdfest,
  units_cdf = "Percent",
  type_cdf = "Continuous",
  logx = "",
  xlbl = NULL,
  ylbl = "Percent",
  ylbl_r = NULL,
  figlab = NULL,
  legloc = "BR",
  confcut = 5,
  conflev = 95,

  ...
)
}
\arguments{
\item{cdfest}{Data frame utilizing the same structure as the data frame
named "CDF" that is included in the output object produced by function
cont.analysis.  The data frame must contain only a single cdf estimate.}

\item{units_cdf}{Indicator for the type of units in which the CDF is
plotted, where "Percent" means the plot is in terms of percent of the
population, and "Units" means the plot is in terms of units of the
population.  The default is "Percent".}

\item{type_cdf}{Character string consisting of the value "Continuous" or
"Ordinal" that controls the type of CDF plot for each indicator.  The
default is "Continuous".}

\item{logx}{Character string consisting of the value "" or "x" that
controls whether the x axis uses the original scale ("") or the base 10
logarithmic scale ("x").  The default is "".}

\item{xlbl}{Character string providing the x-axis label.  If this argument
equals NULL, then the indicator name is used as the label.  The default is
NULL.}

\item{ylbl}{Character string providing the y-axis label.  The default is
"Percent".}

\item{ylbl_r}{Character string providing the label for the right side
y-axis, where NULL means a label is not created, and "Same" means the label
is the same as the left side label (i.e., argument ylbl).  The default is
NULL.}

\item{figlab}{Character string providing the plot title.  The default is
NULL.}

\item{legloc}{Indicator for location of the plot legend, where "BR" means
bottom right, "BL" means bottom left, "TR" means top right, and "TL" means
top left.  The default is "BR".}

\item{confcut}{Numeric value that controls plotting confidence limits at
the CDF extremes.  Confidence limits for CDF values (percent scale) less
than confcut or greater than 100 minus confcut are not plotted.  A value of
zero means confidence limits are plotted for the complete range of the CDF.
The default is 5.}

\item{conflev}{Numeric value of the confidence level used for confidence
limits. The default is 95.}

\item{cex.main}{Expansion factor for the plot title.  The default is 1.2.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the plot function.}
}
\value{
A plot of the CDF and its associated confidence limits.
}
\description{
This function creates a CDF plot.  Input data for the plots is provided by a
data frame utilizing the same structure as the data frame named "CDF" that is
included in the output object produced by function cont.analysis, but the
data frame includes only the values for a single CDF.  Confidence limits for
the CDF also are plotted.
