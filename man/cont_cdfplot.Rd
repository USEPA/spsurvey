}
\arguments{
\item{pdffile}{Name of the PDF file.  The default is "cdf2x2.pdf".}

\item{cdfest}{Data frame utilizing the same structure as the data frame
named "CDF" that is included in the output object produced by function
cont.analysis.}

\item{units_cdf}{Indicator for the type of units in which the CDF is
plotted, where "Percent" means the plot is in terms of percent of the
population, and "Units" means the plot is in terms of units of the
population.  The default is "Percent".}

\item{ind_type}{Character vector consisting of the values "Continuous" or
"Ordinal" that controls the type of CDF plot for each indicator.  The
default is "Continuous" for every indicator.}

\item{logx}{Character vector consisting of the values "" or "x" that
controls whether the x axis uses the original scale ("") or the base 10
logarithmic scale ("x") for each indicator.  The default is "" for every
indicator.}

\item{xlbl}{Character vector consisting of the x-axis label for each
indicator. If this argument equals NULL, then indicator names are used as
the labels. The default is NULL.}

\item{ylbl}{Character string providing the y-axis label.  The default is
"Percent".}

\item{ylbl_r}{Character string providing the label for the right side
y-axis, where NULL means a label is not created, and "Same" means the label
is the same as the left side label (i.e., argument ylbl).  The default is
NULL.}

\item{legloc}{Indicator for location of the plot legend, where "BR" means
bottom right, "BL" means bottom left, "TR" means top right, and "TL" means
top left.  The default is "BR".}

\item{cdf_page}{Number of CDF plots on each page, which must be chosen from
the values: 1, 2, 4, or 6.  The default is 4.}

\item{width}{Width of the graphic region in inches.  The default is 10.}

\item{height}{Height of the graphic region in inches.  The default is 8.}

\item{confcut}{Numeric value that controls plotting confidence limits at
the CDF extremes.  Confidence limits for CDF values (percent scale) less
than confcut or greater than 100 minus confcut are not plotted.  A value of
zero means confidence limits are plotted for the complete range of the CDF.
The default is 5.}

\item{cex.main}{Expansion factor for the plot title.  The default is 1.2.}

\item{...}{Additional arguments passed to the \code{cdf_plot} function.}
}
\value{
A PDF file containing the CDF plots.
}
\description{
This function creates a pdf file containing CDF plots.  Input data for the
plots is provided by a data frame utilizing the same structure as the data
frame named "CDF" that is included in the output object produced by function
\code{cont_analysis}.  Plots are produced for every combination of Type of
population, subpopulation within Type, and indicator.
