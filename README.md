# spsurvey

`spsurvey` is comprised of functions which implement algorithms for design and analysis of probability surveys.  The functions are tailored for Generalized Random Tessellation Stratified survey designs.

## Installation

You can install the released version from CRAN using:

```r
# install from CRAN
install.packages('spsurvey')
library(spsurvey)
```

You can install `spsurvey` from github with:

```r
# requires devtools to install
install.packages('devtools')
library(devtools)

# install from repository
install_github('USEPA/spsurvey')
library(spsurvey)
```

### Using the functions

A overview of the spsurvey package is provided a users guide that is included with the package.  The documentation includes a number of vignettes for the design and analysis of survey designs for point (finite), linear and area (polygons) spatial features.  Vignettes are also available for typical survey analyses.
